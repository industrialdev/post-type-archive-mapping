Post Type Archive Mapping
===================

Map a page to the archive of your post types.

Features
----------------------

<ul>
<li>Select a Private or Public page to use as your post type archive page.</li>
<li>View the archive and you will see the page content instead of the archive content.</li>
<li>Use page templates on your pages for flexibility.</li>
</ul>

## Note

Your post types need to have `has_archive` set to true.

Installation
---------------------
Go to Settings->Reading. At the bottom you will see a place to map your post types.
